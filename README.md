Python Voice Assistant
This project is a rough draft for a voice assistant. 


I've designed this Python Script to respond to "Hey assistant" and from there you can process a few requests.
  *Asking the Time
  *Searching Google for information
  *Tell a joke
  *Setting a timer
  *Telling the weather

I added a speech function so it can respond to you, I tried to add a separate log for history and It appears on request but isn't functional so that will need some work.
I did include a text-to-speech so you can type in your own sentence and it will reply in a robotic voice.

It's functional but could use some TLC.
